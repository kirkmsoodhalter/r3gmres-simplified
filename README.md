# r3gmres-simplified


This is an implementation of a simplified version of the R3GMRES algorithm. The new implementation is proposed in the submitted manuscript: KM Soodhalter. A note on augmented unprojected Krylov subspace methods. arXiv preprint 2106.10050: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10050.

The original R3GMRES was proposed in: Dong, Yiqiu, Henrik Garde, and Per Christian Hansen. R3GMRES: including prior information in GMRES-type methods for discrete inverse problems. Electronic Transactions on Numerical Analysis 42 (2014): 136-146.
